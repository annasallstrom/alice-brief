NOTES ON HOW TO RUN THE IMPLEMENTATIONS:

--- C++:
My Mac running OS 10.9 with xcode had multiple c++ compilers installed.
I can compile using either:
  clang++ test.cp
  g++ test.cp
  clang++ test.cp
then run using:
  ./a.out

--- BASIC:
I installed Vintage BASIC, http://www.vintage-basic.net/
The command to compile & run is:
   vintbas test.bas

--- PYTHON:
As with c++, my Mac already had this:
   python test.py
