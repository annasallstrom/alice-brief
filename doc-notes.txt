The proper construction of those terms mandates an electronic credit and debit
record implemented using a computer and data storage unit; there is no way to
interpret the specification to the contrary.


Case 1:07-cv-00974-RMC Document 95 Filed 09/22/10 Page 14 of 76

The “communications controller” is a specific hardware component that allows
communications over a wide-area computer network. The “data storage unit” is a
specific component, such as a disk drive or file server, capable of storing
data. Ex. 1, Ginsberg Decl. ¶¶ 48, 54. The “computer,” coupled to the data
storage unit, is a computer that is configured, including by the use of
software, to manipulate the data on the data storage unit in order to carry out
the recited functions. Id. ¶¶ 47, 49.
Each independent computer system claim of the ’375 system patent recites the
“communications controller” (and/or a “first party device”), “computer,” and a
“data storage unit” required to run the system, and those terms are incorporated
into each dependent claim. Even without a Markman hearing to construe the claim
terms, it is beyond dispute that Alice’s claims recite concrete computer system
hardware configured to perform a specific function, id. ¶¶ 46-54, 56-58, which
is sufficient to establish as a matter of law that the ’375 patent does not
claim an “abstract idea” and satisfies the requirements of § 101.


Case 1:07-cv-00974-RMC Document 95 Filed 09/22/10 Page 17 of 76

The settlement transaction is “effect[ed]” when the “first account” and “third
account” are “electronically adjusted.” Ex. 1, Ginsberg Decl. ¶ 36. This step,
at a minimum, requires the use of an “electronic” device capable of adjusting
two accounts that it “maintains”—i.e., a computer. Id. ¶ 38. In addition, the
electronic adjustment of account data maintained by the supervisory institution
necessarily results in a physical, electronic change in the medium in which the
data are stored, thus requiring an electronic data storage unit. Id. ¶ 37.
Each claim of the ’510 patent contains the term “electronically.” The
prosecution history indicates that the term “electronically” was added to
overcome a rejection under § 101. In other words, the patent examiner considered
and rejected the argument CLS now makes—that the ’510 patent is not directed to
patent-eligible subject matter. In this regard, the examiner initially rejected
the claims as “lack[ing] any specific technology such as a computer.” See CLS
Ex. 5, Office Action at 3 (Sep. 3, 2003). An initial rejection is common, and is
part of the process of ensuring that patents which issue are valid.2 Alice then
added the term “electronically” to the claims of the ’510 patent to overcome the
examiner’s rejection and expedite the prosecution of the patents. See CLS Ex. 6,
Amend. and Reply Under 37 C.F.R. § 1.111, at 22 (Oct. 31, 2003). The addition of
the term “electronically” to Alice’s claims satisfied the examiner’s concerns—
i.e., it required “specific technology such as a computer.” Id. Indeed, the
examiner agreed with Alice that its claims were directed to a “real world”
exchange of obligations and were an improvement on the state of the art. See CLS
Ex. 6, Amend. and Reply at 22.

Case 1:07-cv-00974-RMC Document 95 Filed 09/22/10 Page 18 of 76
While these claims do not expressly recite that the method must be implemented
“electronically,” these claims use the terms “shadow credit record” and “shadow
debit record.” A person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize these are
electronic records requiring the implementation of these methods on a computer,
using an electronic data storage unit. Id.; see also ’479 patent, col. 24 l.
65–col. 25 l. 2 (“The process effects these payment/receipts in a two-stage
process. First, by debiting/crediting, on a real-time basis, the relevant shadow
records (in the data file PAYACC SHADOW) of the applicable stakeholder
accounts.”). “[D]ata file PAYACC SHADOW” is a reference to data files in a data
storage unit.

“Electronic[] adjust[ment]” is not performed merely in order to speed up a
calculation that could otherwise be performed off line. CLS Mem. at 31. That
electronic adjustment step, along with the maintenance of electronic accounts,
and the generation of electronic instructions, are carried out because the
computer implementing the claimed method acts as an electronic third party
between two counterparties in an effort to minimize the risk that one
counterparty will default.


Case 1:07-cv-00974-RMC Document 95 Filed 09/22/10 Page 49 of 76
“Electronically adjusting” is part of the “solution” itself. The purpose of the
“adjust[ment]” step is not to store the result of any calculation, but instead
to effectuate the exchange in a risk-free manner.
...
The method of the ’510 patent as a whole is performed electronically. The same
accounts or records that are electronically adjusted are also “maintain[ed].”
E.g., ’510 patent, claim 68 (“maintaining a first account . . . ; electronically
adjusting said first account”). An account or record that is amenable to
electronic adjustment will necessarily be stored electronically. The transaction
begins when an electronic instruction is “receiv[ed]” and the transaction ends
when an electronic instruction is “generat[ed]” to the exchange institution. Ex.
1, Ginsberg Decl. ¶¶ 37-38. Thus, the entirety of Alice’s method—including the
“adjusting” step that effectuates the claimed exchange of obligations—must be
performed electronically using a computer and memory. Id. The same is true for
claims 33 and 34 of the ’479 patent, when properly construed.
NOTE: Alice does not argue that "receiving" and "generating" steps are not
pre/post solution activity here.

Case: 11-1301 Document: 22 Page: 14 Filed: 06/24/2011
This execution of an agreed-upon exchange, known in the financial world as
"settlement," typically happens sometime after the parties' agreement to do the
exchange, and carries with it the risk that one party will perform but the other
party
will not, a risk that could exceed the economic value of the transaction. For
example, the expected profit from a currency exchange might be far less than the
amount of money that one party would lose if it performed its half of the
transaction (sending, for instance, its dollars) while its counterparty failed
to
perform (that is, not sending the agreed amount of euros in return).

Case: 11-1301 Document: 22 Page: 15 Filed: 06/24/2011
in the case of currency trades). JA868 (e.g., '375 patent, claim 14). Upon
receiving a transaction from the user, and after ensuring that there was
adequate
value in each party's account, the computer would (in real time) adjust the
accounts it maintained to effect the exchange. Id. (If either party's account
lacked
adequate value, the computer would not initiate the exchange.) Finally, sometime
thereafter, the computer would generate an instruction to the exchange
institution
or institutions to carry out the transaction in their "real-world" accounts. Id.
For
example, in the case of currency settlements, the system might generate and send
instructions to the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank and the European Central Bank to
move dollars and euros to the parties' accounts with those central banks.

Case: 11-1301 Document: 22 Page: 17 Filed: 06/24/2011
The "communications controller" is a specific hardware component that
allows communications over a wide-area computer network. JA1017 (¶ 54). The
"data storage unit" is a specific component, such as a disk drive or file
server,
capable of storing data. JA1015, 1017 (¶¶ 48, 54). The "computer" is a computer
that is coupled to the data storage unit and configured with software to
manipulate
the data on that data storage unit in a particular way in order to carry out the
recited
functions.

Case: 11-1301 Document: 22 Page: 55 Filed: 06/24/2011
For example, if two counterparties want to exchange dollars for euros, they want
either the dollars to flow one way and the euros to flow the other or neither
the
dollars nor the euros to flow. The situation to be avoided is one where the
dollars
flow one way and the corresponding euros do not. The claims require that a
computer system first carry out the transaction in its own internal records by
"updating shadow records in real-time," and second "effect... the exchange of
obligations in accounts maintained external[ly] .... from time to time."


Case: 11-1301 Document: 33 Page: 8 Filed: 09/16/2011
Alice's claims require that a computer maintain electronic accounts for the
parties
to an exchange that are separate from the parties' real-world accounts. The
computer performs the parties' exchange in these separate, or "shadow," accounts
if there is sufficient value in each account, and then, sometime thereai_er,
generates
an instruction to make the appropriate adjustments in the parties' real-world
accounts.


Case: 11-1301 Document: 194 Page: 44 Filed: 01/10/2013
As the panel correctly observed, Alice's claims require a particular sequence
ofcomputer-implemented steps that "exchang[e] obligations maintained at an
exchange institution" in a "specific way." Panel Op., 685 F.3d at 1355 (citing
JA386, claim 33). That "specific way" requires "creating electronically
maintained shadow credit and shadow debit records" which must "be held
independently" ofthe parties' real-world accounts at exchange institutions. !d.
It requires that those records be adjusted electronically "based on only certain
specified allowed transactions," i.e., when particular criteria are met to
ensure that both parties have adequate value to perform the exchange. !d. It
requires, at least in the case of claim 33 ofthe '479 patent, that
"start-of-the-day balances be obtained from the exchange institution," that
"adjustments be made in chronological order," and that "at the end of the day,
instructions be given to the
exchange institution to reflect the adjustments made on the basis ofthe
permitted transactions." !d. And it requires that the instructions sent to the
exchange institution be "irrevocable, time invariant obligations placed on the
exchange institution." !d.

Case: 11-1301 Document: 194 Page: 48 Filed: 01/10/2013
Alice's claims have numerous additional limitations, including that the shadow
accounts that are created and maintained by the computer be "held independently"
ofaccounts at the exchange institution; that transactions only affect the
account balances ifparticular criteria are met; that adjustments be made in
chronological order; and that the exchange culminate with the issuance o f an
"irrevocable, time invariant obligation[] placed on the exchange institution."


Case 1:07-cv-00974-RMC Document 53 Filed 04/03/2009 Page 35 of 70
Because the claim term “electronically” (which is present in every claim of the
’510 patent) limits the claimed settlement method to an implementation tied to
electronic hardware (a machine), the claimed methods are patent-eligible.

Case 1:07-cv-00974-RMC Document 53 Filed 04/03/2009 Page 45 of 70
Because a proper analysis requires the Court to interpret the meaning of the
claim terms, with reference to the specification and from the perspective of a
person of ordinary skill in the art, and because CLS will be able to dispute
Alice’s interpretation of the relevant claim terms other than the clear
“computer,” “data storage unit,” and “electronically” terms found only in the
’720 system patent and the ’510 method patent (and discussed above), Alice has
not cross-moved for partial summary judgment as to the ’479 patent. Such a claim
construction will reveal that certain claim terms in the ’479 patent—which are
common to all three patents—would be understood by a person of ordinary skill in
the art to limit the claims to a computer or the use of a computer. Id.


The ’510 patent, however, is amenable to summary judgment in Alice’s favor (even
without considering other issues of claim construction) because the term
“electronically” ties the
Case 1:07-cv-00974-RMC Document 68 Filed 05/19/2009 Page 6 of 30
method to a particular machine, even without construction of all the other claim
terms. There is no serious dispute about what the term “electronically” means.



The specification undoubtedly provides context for reading a patent’s claims,
but the plain language of the claims themselves is the measure of the breadth of
patent protection granted. See Innova/Pure Water, Inc. v. Safari Water
Filtration Sys., 381 F.3d 1111, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 2004).


Case 1:07-cv-00974-RMC Document 104 Filed 03/09/11 Page 43 of 57
Also, that the methods entail an irrevocable instruction, assumed to be
electronic in nature, to require that exchange institutions adjust their
accounts or records according to the exchange conducted by the supervisory
institution is subsumed within the abstract idea itself, if not insignificant
postsolution activity. See Flook, 437 U.S. at 590 (“The notion that
post-solution activity, no matter how conventional or obvious in itself, can
transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process exalts form over
substance.”); Bilski I, 545 F.3d at 966 (noting that abstract hedging claims
required “performing the post-solution step of consummating those
transactions”). In claiming the abstract idea of using an intermediary to
guarantee the exchange of obligations to minimize risk, the final action that
the parties, or their account holders, be met with an irrevocable instruction to
adjust their account or record to reflect the consummated transaction is no more
an inherent and necessary step in the abstract idea, if not an obvious
post-solution step.

System claim 64, on the other hand, essentially enables a purchase between a
buyer and seller, in which the system recited maintains a shadow account for a
buyer and seller independent of those held by a bank, and the computer is
configured to receive a transaction, adjust the accounts of the buyer and seller
to effectuate the purchase if the accounts have sufficient value, and to
generate an irrevocable instruction to the bank(s) to adjust their account(s)
accordingly. See ’720 Patent, col. 68:62–66 & col. 69:1–11.
